# Digital-Accountablity-Scorecard
Digital Accountability Scorecard (DAS)

Digital Accountability Scorecard (DAS) is a conceptual gov-tech mobile application designed to enhance transparency, accoufntability, and youth participation in democratic governance. Built using React Native, the app presents public governance data through simple scorecards and progress indicators, making institutional performance accessible to citizens.

DAS aggregates verified government data, converts it into measurable performance metrics—such as grievance resolution, scheme completion, fund utilisation, and citizen feedback—and visualises them in a mobile-first, citizen-friendly interface. The system is designed with privacy-by-design principles, using anonymised and aggregated data only.

This project is developed as a prototype and policy demonstration, aligned with VBYLD 2026 and Viksit Bharat @2047, showcasing how digital public infrastructure can empower youth to move from passive participation to data-driven democratic engagement.
